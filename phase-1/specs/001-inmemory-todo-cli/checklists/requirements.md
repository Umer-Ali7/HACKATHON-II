## Validation Results

| Category | Items | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | PASS |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- All 6 user stories have clear acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- 11 functional requirements defined with testable criteria
- 8 success criteria with measurable metrics
- 5 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- Clear Out of Scope section prevents scope creep
